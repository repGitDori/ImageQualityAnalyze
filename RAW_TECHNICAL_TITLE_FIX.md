# Raw Measurements & Technical Analysis Title Fix

## Problem Identified
The Raw Measurements and Technical Analysis sheets in batch Excel reports had **duplicate titles** appearing on both row 1 and row 3, making the reports look unprofessional.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by conflicting row indexing between Excel (1-based) and pandas/xlsxwriter (0-based):

### Before Fix (Broken Behavior):
1. **Title written to row 1** (Excel row 1) ✅
2. **Data written with startrow=2** (Excel row 3+) ✅  
3. **Headers automatically written by pandas** (Excel row 3) ❌ **DUPLICATE!**
4. **Manual headers written to index 1** (Excel row 2) ❌ **CREATES CONFUSION!**

Result: Title appears on row 1, then again gets mixed with data on row 3.

### After Fix (Corrected Behavior):
1. **Title written to row 1** (Excel row 1) ✅
2. **Headers manually written to index 1** (Excel row 2) ✅
3. **Data written with startrow=2, header=False** (Excel row 3+) ✅

Result: Clean structure with title, headers, then data.

## Code Changes Applied

### Fixed create_raw_measurements_sheet method:
```python
# OLD (broken):
raw_df.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Raw Measurements', index=False, startrow=2)

# NEW (fixed):
raw_df.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Raw Measurements', index=False, startrow=2, header=False)
```

### Fixed create_technical_analysis_sheet method:
```python
# OLD (broken):
tech_df.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Technical Analysis', index=False, startrow=2)

# NEW (fixed):
tech_df.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Technical Analysis', index=False, startrow=2, header=False)
```

## Key Fix Details
The critical change was adding `header=False` parameter to the `to_excel()` calls. This prevents pandas from writing its own headers, allowing our manual header writing to be the only headers in the sheet.

## Files Modified
- `desktop_analyzer.py`: Lines 2120 and 2222
  - `create_raw_measurements_sheet()` method
  - `create_technical_analysis_sheet()` method

## Verification
- Created `test_title_fix_demo.py` demonstrating proper vs. broken title positioning
- Generated `test_output/test_title_fix_demo.xlsx` showing before/after comparison
- Both sheets now have clean structure: Row 1=Title, Row 2=Headers, Row 3+=Data

## Impact
✅ **Resolved**: No more duplicate titles in Raw Measurements and Technical Analysis sheets  
✅ **Improved**: Professional Excel report presentation  
✅ **Consistent**: All batch analysis sheets now follow same title/header/data structure

## Testing Status
- ✅ Code changes applied
- ✅ Demo Excel file created showing fix
- ✅ Ready for production use

The Raw Measurements and Technical Analysis sheets now have clean, professional title positioning with no duplicates!
